It takes two to tango
And two lips to steal a kiss
But a flame and a candle
Won't burn on a night like this
It don't take two

It takes two to go one way
And two winds to be strong enough
You can't sail on a still day
Like two ships on a sea of love
It don't take two

Noah knew what he had to do
Oh,yeah
He sent us out in the world walkin' two by two oh

(If it don't take two),if it don't take two
(If it don't take two),if I'm not with you
It ain't worth goin' through
If it don't take two

It takes two hearts with one beat
And it takes two to say I do
But the champagne won't taste sweet
And the dream just won't come true
If it don't take two

Noah knew what he had to do, oh yeah
He sent us out in the world walkin' two by two,oh

If it don't take two,(if it don't take two)
If it don't take two,(if it don't take two
If I'm not with you)
Iit ain't worth goin' through
If it don't take two

He sent us out in the world walkin' two by two
Me and you
Baby

If it don't take two,(if it don't take two)
If I'm not with you
No, it ain't worth goin' through
If it don't take two

No, if it don't take two,(if it don't take two)
If it don't take two,(if I'm not with you
No it ain't worth goin' through
If it don't take two

If it don't take two
If I'm not with you
It ain't worth goin' through
No,no,no
